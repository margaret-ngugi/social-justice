            <h2>Our short story</h2>
        <p>It was a warm summer night when I first had the idea for my</p>
        <p>social justice web application. I had just finished a passionate </p>
        <p>conversation with some friends about the need for accessible resources</p>
        <p>for those marginalized by society. We discussed the various </p>
        <p>issues that people face, including police brutality, </p>
        <p>income inequality, and racial and gender discrimination.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>The idea struck me like a bolt of lightning. Why not create</p>
            <p>a centralized platform where anyone can come together to</p>
            <p> fight for social justice? And so, my journey began.</p>
            <p>I spent countless hours researching and learning about the various </p>
            <p>issues plaguing our society. I studied the laws and regulations </p>
            <p> that protect the rights of individuals, and I spoke</p>
            <p>  with people directly affected by these injustices.</p>

      <div>
        <p>My aim was simple: to create a web application that would allow </p>
        <p>anyone with a passion for social justice to come together and </p>
        <p> make a difference. I wanted to provide a platform for marginalized</p>
        <p>communities to share their experiences, and for allies to show their</p>
          <p>support</p>
        </div>
          <div>
             <p>This platform aims to empower individuals to fight against</p>
              <p>discrimination and promote social justice. Stay informed </p>
              <p>about incidents happening around the resources and tools to</p>
              <p>track discrimination and report it.</p>
